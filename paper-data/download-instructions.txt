Note that chrX and chrY were excluded in our analysis

The VCF for all SVs (LRGT + Clustered SVs):
https://paragraph-paper-data.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/sample3-sw.sorted.vcf.gz

In the filter field, we have "PASS" for LRGT SVs and "NEARBY" for clustered SVs. Note that chrX and chrY were excluded in all analysis in our manuscript.
